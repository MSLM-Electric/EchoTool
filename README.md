EchoTool - Echo client and server
=================================

Command line echo server and client for Windows. This tool is designed according to [RFC 862 specification]([http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0862.txt?number=862]) for Echo protocol. It can operate as a echo server that sends back every incoming data. In client mode, it sends data to the server and checks whether they came back. This is a useful debugging tool for application development or network throughput checks. Application is written in C# and source codes is provided.

You can specify outgoing local port by /l switch
